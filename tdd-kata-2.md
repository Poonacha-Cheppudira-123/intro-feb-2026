# Use the Rest of the Day To:

- Try TDD - Kata 2 - You can use my code as a reference.
- But what I really want you doing is thinking about this test double thing.
- [Instructions Here](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-2)
- Take my code, look at it. Read it. Debug it. 
- BUILD AS MUCH OF THIS MENTAL MODEL AS YOU CAN.
- At least get to the point where you can verbalize something close to a question.

- Why do we use test doubles?
- What is a test double?
- Extra Credit: what is meant by a dummy, stub, mock, or fake.
- Why is this so important?
- This is not the question: That you can do this on your own 100%
